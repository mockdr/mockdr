## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Graph, MDE and Sentinel token endpoints now accept the tenant-scoped URL real
  Entra ID uses (`/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token`) in addition to the bare path, so
  clients that mirror the Microsoft authority shape no longer fall through to
  the SPA catch-all and get a misleading `405 Method Not Allowed` ([#22]).
  A tenant that does not match the credential's tenant is rejected with
  `400 invalid_request`; set `MOCKDR_STRICT_TENANT=false` to accept any tenant.
